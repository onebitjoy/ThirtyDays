## Description
In this project, I solved the Android Development with Jetpack Compose's exercise which asked me
to create an application for affirmations(which I modified for monsters) with atleast 30 entries.

This app involves the following implementations -

1. LazyColumn(30 items)
2. Created a repository for 30 monsters(images, names and description)
3. Every column item is expandable by clicking.
4. Material 2 themeing.

Thank You! ðŸ¤©
